# loadings-similarity
Eigenvectors or loadings similarity approach for the selection of number of components in PCA

Accompaning article: [Notes on the number of components in PCA: R², Q² & eigenvectors similarity](https://towardsdatascience.com/notes-on-the-number-of-components-in-pca-r%C2%B2-q%C2%B2-eigenvectors-similarity-60a19b2f671a).

Please leave a comment if you find this method helpful (if it is of general interest, I will publish further validation benchmarks and a ready-to-use Python package).
